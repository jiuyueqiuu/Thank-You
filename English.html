  <h1> A Message from Me to You </h1>

  <p>Hello there. You must be wondering what this is. In simple words, this is a program I wrote before my birthday. I’ve never been someone with clever words, and I’ve never been great at expressing my thanks. But I wanted to do something different this year. I wanted to give the people who say happy birthday to me a thank you that comes straight from my heart. Being a computer science student, this was the best way I knew how. So please, if you have a little time, read on.</p>

  <p>Thank you. This birthday is special, for it’s my 18th. However, it’s also unlike any birthday I’ve ever had, because it’s my first one with no lifelong friends or family to celebrate with. Just a month ago, I moved to France, and here I am—in a new country, a new life, surrounded by unfamiliar streets and faces that don’t yet know me. It’s exciting, yes, but it’s also lonely. Birthdays are supposed to be about gathering with people you love, but this year, the silence is louder, the distance is heavier.</p>

  <p>That’s why your “happy birthday” matters so much to me. It may feel small to you—just a few words—but to me, it’s a spell. It reminds me that I’m not forgotten. That even if I am far away from everything familiar, kindness can still reach me. Your wish closes the distance, and for a moment, I don’t feel quite so alone in this new place.</p>

  <p>I don’t know who you are, not at the time of writing this. You might be someone I’ve known for years, or maybe someone who just recently entered my life. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you thought of me—that you paused in the middle of your own life and chose to give me a moment of light in mine. That is something I’ll carry with me long after today.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I would like to share with you something. It’s, in my opinion, the most valuable thing I have learned in the past years.</p>

  <p>Consider this: who is your best friend ever? Truly, who is it? For me, I believe a human’s best friend is, and always should be, themselves. Think about it. You built a connection with yourself first, before you ever reached out to the outside world. As you grew up, you were the first to discover what you like and dislike, how you think, how you speak, how you act. And yet, as we grow older, we seem to lose that connection with ourselves. We begin to care more about exploring the world around us, about chasing knowledge and experiences. That’s good, of course, but locking away your lifelong friend—yourself—in the back of your heart is a cruel thing to do. Even worse is when you mistreat yourself for small mistakes. You would never belittle a friend or look down on them, so why do it to yourself? Failed a test? So fucking be it. Didn’t get into the university you wanted? So fucking be it. You did all you could. Your best friend did all they could. Hug yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back. You are the best.</p>

  <p>And so, as I step into this new chapter of my life—my 18th year—I want to remember this: to treat myself as my own closest friend, and to never take for granted the kindness of others, no matter how small it may seem. If you’re reading this, know that you’ve made my birthday brighter. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">You got this, friend. No matter where you are, please remember that you are not alone. May our paths cross again sometime in the future. For now, allow me to wish you a most fortunate year! I always love you!</p>
